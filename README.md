Divide.io
===========

## Note: Development is currently halted for this project from the main developers. We will continue to maintain the project, so if you're interesting in helping with development please see [contributing](https://github.com/HiddenStage/divide/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Divide.io is an open source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). It provides tools to easily, securely, and efficiently communicate between your app and a server. It handles data storage, user registration & management, and push notifications.

Deploy anywhere. Use any database you want. Never get locked into a platform.

Visit [our website](http://www.divide.io/) for more information.

#### How does it work?
Divide.io provides easy to use APIs to connect your mobile app to a backend. Getting up and running is simple.

1. Choose your server provider. Any server that runs Java should suffice.
2. Download and initialize our backend library in your server.
3. Download and initialize our client library in your app.
4. That's it!

You can now use our APIs to communicate back and forth to your backend. Saving data, querying, registering and logging in users, etc. are now just a few lines of code away!
